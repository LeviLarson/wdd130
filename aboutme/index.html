    <h2>Levi Larson</h2>
    <p>Hey everybody, my name is Levi. I'm from Georgia 
        and I'm also studying Computer Science. This is my first semester, and 
        the only coding experience I have is one class from my senior year (it's been a couple of years).</p>
    <p>I sereved my mission in the Mexico Pachuca Mission and had a reassignment for the pandemic in the Arizona Tempe Mission.
        I spent about a year in both missions, and I definitely loved both of them. A funny moment I had on
        my  mission happened when I had to get my Visa renewd to return to Mexico. Some confusion happened with the name of a 
        sister and so I basically was companions with a sister missionary for a day. It was pretty cool because her grandpa 
        took us out to eat and I ended up saving the money tehy gave me for a taxi.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are going to the gym, playing soccer and frisbee, and hanging out with the homies.
         If you ever want to lift or play sports I'm always looking for a buddy.</p>
